# AnimSolvers
This is a plugin developped under Unreal Engine framework which aims to implement some of the most famous IK solvers.
The idea here is to implement some of the inverse kinematics solvers in order to add some additional features, such as constraints.

## List of solvers:
* FABRIK with constraints

## Solvers left to implement
* Two Bone IK
* CCDIK (Cyclic Coordinate Descent Inverse Kinematics)
* ...
